	description:
		"Livostin eye drops are used as short-term treatment to relieve symptoms of pollen allergy. It is histamine that causes eye problems and Livostin blocks the effect of histamine. The product works after about 15 minutes. Livostin contains the preservative benzalkonium chloride, which can cause eye irritation and discolour soft contact lenses. Soft contact lenses should therefore not be used at the same time as this product. If you must use soft contact lenses, these should be removed before use and then you should wait at least 15 minutes after administration before reinserting the lenses.",
