	pharmacodynamics:
		"Bisakodyl exerts its effect through local influence on the colon wall, which increases peristalsis. In addition, water and electrolytes accumulate in the colon. The result is defecation stimulation, shortened passage time and looser/softer stools.bisakodyl, with its action in the large intestine, stimulates the natural bowel emptying process specifically in the lower part of the gastrointestinal system. Bisacodyl cannot therefore be used to affect the digestion of food or the absorption of calories or nutrients from the small intestine.",
