	pharmacodynamics:
		"Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis is an important part of the mechanism of action as prostaglandins play a major role in pain, inflammation, fever and migraine. Ibuprofen inhibits the enzymes (COX) and COX-2, which reduces the production of prostaglandins such as PGE2 at the source of pain and/or inflammation. Ibuprofen also blocks the formation of prostaglandin F2Î± which causes hypercontractility in the uterus in dysmenorrhea.",
	description:
		"Ipren is used for mild to moderate pain. The product is also antipyretic and anti-inflammatory. For adults and children from 12 years. Ipren can be used, for example, for back pain, joint pain, fever during a cold or to alleviate problems caused by osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. The effect is usually achieved within 30 minutes after ingestion and the maximum effect is reached within approx. 1-2 hours. The tablet is film-coated, which makes it easier to swallow. If the condition has not improved within 5 days, consult a doctor",
